# LinkStash API

This document describes the API endpoint that the ash application sends link data to.

### POST /api/add

Adds a new link to the collection.

Voting behavior:
- If the URL is new, the link is created with `count = 1`.
- If the URL already exists, it is treated as a vote attempt.
- Repeated vote attempts from the same submitter/room fingerprint within the cooldown window are ignored to prevent accidental or spammy rapid upvotes.
- Cooldown is configurable with `VOTE_COOLDOWN_MS` (defaults to 6 hours).

#### Headers

- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` - Required authentication token
- `Content-Type: application/json` - Content type

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "link": {
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "submittedBy": "@user:matrix.org"
  },
  "room": {
    "id": "!roomid:matrix.org",
    "comment": "room name"
  }
}
```

#### Fields

- `link.url` (string, required): The URL of the link
- `link.submittedBy` (string, optional): Matrix user ID of the person who submitted the link (accepted on POST but not exposed in public GET responses)
- `room.id` (string, optional): Matrix room ID (accepted on POST but not exposed in public GET responses)
- `room.comment` (string, optional): Room comment/name (accepted on POST and included in public GET responses as `roomComment`)

#### Example curl command

```bash
curl -X POST "https://linkstash.hsp-ec.xyz/api/add" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mentor-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "link": {
      "url": "https://example.com",
      "submittedBy": "@user:matrix.org"
    },
    "room": {
      "id": "!roomid:matrix.org",
      "comment": "room name"
    }
  }'
```

#### Configuration

The ash application sends this data based on configuration flags in `config.json`:

- `sendUser`: Include the `submittedBy` field
- `sendTopic`: Include the `room` object

Both flags are optional and can be set per room.

### GET /api/feed

Returns an RSS 2.0 XML feed of links in the collection, ordered by newest first.

The feed includes attribution (submitter), room comment, tags, vote count, domain, and an excerpt for each link.

#### Query Parameters

- `mode` (optional): Ranking mode. Values: `latest` (default), `top`
- `limit` (optional): Number of items to include (default: 50, max: 200)

#### Example curl commands

```bash
# Get RSS feed
curl "https://linkstash.hsp-ec.xyz/api/feed"

# Get top-voted feed
curl "https://linkstash.hsp-ec.xyz/api/feed?mode=top&limit=20"
```

### GET /api/links

Retrieves all links in the collection, ordered by timestamp (newest first).

#### Query Parameters

- `url` (optional): Filter by specific URL to get a single link
- `mode` (optional): Ranking mode for list responses. Values: `latest` (default), `top`, `rising`

#### Response

Returns a JSON array of link objects, or a single link object if `url` parameter is provided.

Ranking modes:
- `latest`: newest first, tie-broken by vote count
- `top`: highest vote count first, tie-broken by recency
- `rising`: boosts links with growing votes while applying time decay to surface fresher suggestions

#### Example curl commands

```bash
# Get all links
curl "https://linkstash.hsp-ec.xyz/api/links"

# Get specific link by URL
curl "https://linkstash.hsp-ec.xyz/api/links?url=https://example.com"
```

### GET /api/summary

Retrieves a summary of links for a date range.

#### Query Parameters

- `from` (optional): Start date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- `to` (optional): End date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- `room` (optional): Room name/comment filter (case-insensitive)

Notes:
- If `from`/`to` are omitted, the API defaults to the latest 7-day window with links.
- `day` is still accepted for backwards compatibility and is treated as `from=day&to=day`.

#### Response

Returns a JSON object with:
- `from`: Start day used for the summary (string or null)
- `to`: End day used for the summary (string or null)
- `room`: Active room filter or `null`
- `rooms`: Array of available room buckets for the selected date range, with counts
- `total`: Number of links in `summary`
- `summary`: Array of links posted in that range (same format as `/api/links`)

#### Example curl commands

```bash
# Get summary for the default latest 7-day range
curl "https://linkstash.hsp-ec.xyz/api/summary"

# Get summary for a specific date range
curl "https://linkstash.hsp-ec.xyz/api/summary?from=2023-12-20&to=2023-12-25"

# Get summary for a range filtered to one room
curl "https://linkstash.hsp-ec.xyz/api/summary?from=2023-12-20&to=2023-12-25&room=room%20name"
```
